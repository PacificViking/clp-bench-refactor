# LogArchivalBench How To
## Setup

Run the following code to setup the virtual environment, add the python files in src to python's
import path, then run the venv

```
python3 -m venv venv
```
```
echo "$(pwd)" > $(find venv/lib -maxdepth 1 -mindepth 1 -type d)/site-packages/project_root.pth
```
```
. venv/bin/activate
```
```
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

## Download Datasets

You can download all the datasets we use in the benchmark using the [download\_all.py](scripts/download_all.py) script we provide. 

### Adding A Dataset

The simplest way to add a new dataset is to,

1) Add a new directory under [data](/data) with your dataset's name.   
2) Copy a metadata.yaml file from any other dataset directory under data and fill in the correct information. The number of lines doesnâ€™t matter for the downloading process.You can fill that value in after it is downloaded.  
3) Run the [download\_all.py](scripts/download_all.py) script.

The [download\_all.py](scripts/download_all.py) script will download all datasets into the correct directories the specified names, concentrate multi-file datasets together into a single file, and generate any modified version of the dataset needed for tools like Presto \+ CLP.

## Run Everything

Follow the instructions in above to set up your virtual environment. 

Stay in the [LogArchiveBench](/) directory and run [scripts/benchall.py](/scripts/benchall.py). This script runs the tools \+ parameters in its "benchmarks" variable across all datasets under [data/](/data).

## Run One Tool

Execute `./assets/{tool name}/main.py {path to <dataset name>.log}` to run ingestion and search on that dataset.

## Adding A Tool

1. Copy [assets/template](/assets/template/) to `assets/{toolname}`.
2. Edit the `config.yaml` in this new directory to contain your container's name, relevant processes for memory benchmarking, and queries given to your script. 
3. Edit the `Dockerfile` to modify the environment your tool will run in.
4. Modify `main.py` to modify the class name and populate all the functions. 
5. Modify [scripts/benchall.py](/scripts/benchall.py) to import your class and add it to the benchmarks list.
